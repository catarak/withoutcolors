#Ideas and Notes

* Will need to use an Effects Composer to create the starry background and earth. Where will I find a good starry background?
* Meteors crashing into earth
* No sound -> white noise, high pitched sound maybe

##Script
* instead of having a narrator, change the story such that it's more of a script, the inner monologue of the protagonist, not Ayl. 
* introduction -> what this earth is
* jerk camera to look at ayl
* come up with a few points in which the story stops, and the user has to enter sometime to continue. it's a game in the sense that the user has to interact to continue, but they won't have to do anything or solve any puzzles.
